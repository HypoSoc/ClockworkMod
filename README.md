# ClockworkMod
ClockworkMod is a work in progress mod for the game **Slay the Spire** that introduces a new character, The Clockwork.

The Clockwork Mod will feature 81 cards and 13 exclusive relics. The Clockwork resolves around deck manipulation, building momentum over the course of a fight, as well as over the course of the game.

The Clockwork begins with the Relic **Momentum Engine** which increases the strength of cards every time you play them.

You can change the config to turn off the sound effects.

# Dependencies
BaseMod, ModTheSpire, and STSLib are all required to run ClockworkMod

# Credits
None of the art, other than some of the really terrible stuff, is mine. Images and audio files were taken (with or without modification), mostly from STS game assets, but also from other sources.

I would like to thank the developers of Slay the Spire for making such an amazing game, as well as the mod community for their support and providing such helpful modding resources.
